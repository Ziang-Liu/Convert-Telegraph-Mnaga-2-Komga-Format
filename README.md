# telegraph-2-Komga-format

Since the latest release of [tachiyomi](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi) removed official support for plugins and recommended connecting to self-hosted comic servers, I intend to migrate many of the comics I've read on Telegraph to the open-source comic management project, [komga](https://github.com/gotson/komga). Based on its categorization of tankobon, I have currently made a simple script for the purpose of downloading, packaging, and archiving comics.

## Usage
### Directly use Python File
1. ensure you have installed python
2. download the code
3. open terminal, enter the right location, execute it
### Use the packed exe

## Features plan
- [ ] Integrating this functionality into a Telegram bot.
- [ ] Create a Docker container capable of running on a server.
